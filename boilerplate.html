        <h1>Boilerplate</h1>

        <p>This page is all about boilerplate.</p>
        
        <hr>

        <p>
            Boilerplate is any length of code that serves as a sort of template. It is common to use in web development
            if you want all of your pages to look very similar. Or, in game development when you have a player script that you
            reuse in every project, or an item script that for some reason you don't want to make a class for.
        </p>

        <h2>Boilerplate basics:</h2>
        <p>
            Boilerplate actually draws from the plates steel workers used in making... boilers. Since they need consistency and repetition, they made
            plates that would quickly do the forming process.
            <code>boilerplate is fun.</code>
        </p>

        <div class="imgcap">
            <img src="assets/img/boilerplate.jpg" alt="A boilerplate" style="height: 25em;">
            <p>This image is of a boiler. That's it, nothing else to it. However, its a nice visual for a page about boilerplate.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Boilerplate can be many things. <code>A line of code...</code> or a <code>big file of code</code>, and it is very helpful
            either way. You may be wondering why I am making a page about boilerplate. Well because this page is the boilerplate file for this website. Pull up any
            other page and you will see the similarities.

        <pre><code class="language-java codecont">
lots and lots of boilerplate!
        </code></pre>

        <p>
            Well I've run out of things to say about boilerplate. Just remember, boiler plate is amazing and should never be forgotten, no matter the project.
            Heres how I made this webpage:

            Heres how I made this webpage:
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="language-html codecont"&gt;
            no infinite recursion allowed...
        &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;Explanation:&lt;/h3&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            In this page we explain boilerplate, which makes everything better and more uniform.
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
            One challenge with boilerplate is making sure it contains enough, but not too much. It will take a bit of time, but boilerplate is real easy and simple.
        &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;hr&gt;
        &lt;h3&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h3&gt;

            When you leave this page, no matter how you got here, remember: boilerplate is cool.

            &lt;code&gt;boilerplate never dies&lt;/code&gt;
