                So after coming back to my <a href="../nuke_mod_blog/homepage.html">nuke mod,</a> I kind of put a pause on development of this horror game. Does that mean I will
                never come back to it? Maybe, maybe not. We will see I guess, yolo. What I can promise is that my love and desire for this game and its potential future will never
                seize, at least for a while. I just cannot work on both the game and the mod, because it is jarring switching between the Godot/GD-Script ecosystem and Forge/Java
                ecosystem, and balancing creative budget between them is just exhausting. So, I am putting a temporary (or perhaps indefinite) hold on this game. If I do return to
                the game, my next blog post will be about what I have added. But as for the time being, I am focusing on the mod. I might even return to the game in a month, a week,
                or even later today. Who knows. But just in case it is a while, this is why.
                Bye...
