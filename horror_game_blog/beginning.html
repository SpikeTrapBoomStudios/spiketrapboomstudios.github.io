            <h1>What will this game be?</h1>

            <p>
                Alright, so basically I am making a horror game. Will I finish it? Maybe. 
                However, I am around 2 months into it (with horrible progress to show for it), and I already have some stuff done. My blog started a little late.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am essentially making this game because I like storytelling through games. 
                Something about not shoving backstory and plot down someone's brain through video content, and rather drip feeding it to them through subtle (or sometimes not so much) hints at what the world is about. Why is the player here?
            </p>

            <p>
                Plus, I love Markiplier, 3FS, and Jacksepticeye. And those guys all are big indie horror game players, so making a game that they might play gives me extra motivation. 
                But likely, I won't even ever finish the game, and if I do, it won't be played. But fear not, because I now have this blog! Progress should be steady now.
            </p>

            <p>
                Plus, it's summer. So as long as I don't sleep in until dinner every day, I have all the time in the world.

            <h2>The Story So Far</h2>

            <hr>

            <p>
                The year is 1996. As commerce and globalization reach an all-time high, a small company is growing rapidly. Called <i>The Collection</i>, the company claims to have anything anyone could ever want. Hence their tagline: <b>"You want it, we have it."</b>
            </p>

            <p>
                Going into 1998, in just two years, The Collection has gone from a chain local to Utah to a superstore spanning the world. From America to China, it's everywhere. 
                All other stores have become obsolete. All ecommerce has been replaced. Everything aside from things like real estate and cars has been replaced by The Collection.
            </p>

            <p>
                But with many customers come many returns. The Collection has a store-to-return-facility ratio of 2:1. 
                The issue is, robots canâ€™t handle the complexity of return management and also randomly go missing... 
                Anyways, no issue for The Collection. They simply spend 1 year researching science to bioengineer humans, just to be their mass-produced return workers.
            </p>

            <p>
                Given one worker has a job lifespan of 2 weeks before... disappearing, they need a lot of them.
            </p>

                In the game, you assume the role of one of these return facility employees. 
                Can you be the one to survive longer than the rest, and maybe even... <b>escape?</b>
