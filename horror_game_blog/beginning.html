        <h1>What will this game be?</h1>

        <p>
            Alright so basically I am making a horror game. Will I finish it? Maybe. However, I am around 2 months into it (with horrible progress to show for it),
            and I already have some stuff done. My blog started a little late. I am essentially making this game because I like story telling through games. Something 
            about not shoving backstory and plot down someones brain through video content, and rather drip feeding it to them through subtle (or sometimes not so much) hints
            at what the world is about. Why is the player here? Plus, I love Markiplier, 3FS, and Jacksepticeye. And those guys all are big indie horror game players, so
            making a game that they might play gives me extra motivation. But likely, I won't even ever finish the game, and if I do, it won't be played. But fear not, because
            I now have this blog! Progress should be steady now. Plus, its summer. So as long as I don't sleep in until dinner every day, then I have all the time in the world.
            Anyways, here is the story so far for the game:
            <hr>
            The year is 1996. As commerce and globalization is at an all-time rise, a small company is growing rapidly. Called ‘The Collection’, the company claims to have 
            anything anyone could ever want. Hence their tagline “You want it, we have it.”. Going into 1998, in just two years The Collection has gone from a chain local 
            to Utah to a super store spanning the world. From America to China, its everywhere. All other stores have become obsolete. All ecommerce has been replaced. 
            Everything aside from things like real estate and cars has been replaced by The Collection. But with many customers comes many returns. The Collection has a 
            store to return facility ratio of 2:1. Issue is, robots can’t handle the complexity of return management and also randomly go missing… Anyways, no issue for 
            The Collection. They simply spend 1 year researching science to bioengineer humans, just to be their mass produced return workers. Given one worker has a job 
            lifespan of 2 weeks before… disappearing, they need a lot of them.
            <hr>
            In the game, you assume the role of one of these return facility employees. Can you be the one to survive longer than the rest, and maybe even... <b>escape?</b>
